## My approach

* First, I worked on the Domain Modelling for this CL app, focusing on how many classes I would need and what is the responsibility for each of them.

* After that, and to design the app, I worked on branching the methods each class would have and what are their tasks, assuring each method performs only one task (this was a top priority for me in this exercise).

* TDD: I started working on a class at a time, creating unit tests first for each one of them.
